A shopping website built using react linked to the fake store api (https://fakestoreapi.com/). The information is stored in the local state. The shopping app allows users to create an account as well as login with said account. It allows for adding , removing and updating of products in the cart. The cart also has a check out feature that displays the total cost of all products added to the cart. We used react, javascript, as well as redux in this project to get a better understanding.
